                <h3>What is Dining Philosophers Problem?</h3>
                <p>The dining philosopher's problem is the classical problem of synchronization which says that Five philosophers are sitting around a
                    circular table and their job is to think and eat alternatively. A bowl of noodles is placed at the center of the table along with 
                    five forks for each of the philosophers. To eat a philosopher needs both their right and a left fork. 
                    A philosopher can only eat if both immediate left and right forks of the philosopher is available. In case if
                    both immediate left and right forks of the philosopher are not available then the philosopher puts down their 
                    (either left or right) fork and starts thinking again.
                    <br><br>

                    The dining philosopher demonstrates a large class of concurrency control problems hence it's a classic synchronization problem. In
                    general we commonly use Semaphores and Mutex Locks as the synchronization mechanism. For this instance, we will only be using 
                    semaphore.

                <h3>What is a Semaphore?</h3>
                <p>In the Dining Philosophers problem, 
                    a semaphore is a synchronization tool 
                    that helps manage access to shared resources, 
                    such as forks. It prevents conflicts by 
                    allowing philosophers to check and update the 
                    availability of forks before picking them 
                    up to eat. Semaphores play a crucial role in 
                    avoiding deadlock and ensuring orderly 
                    resource usage in a concurrent dining scenario. 
                    For this problem, we will be using binary semaphore 
                    which means that there can be only two answers that is
                    True (1) or False (0).</p>

                <h3>What is a deadlock and why is it important to remove?</h3>
                <p>A deadlock in concurrent programming happens when
                    multiple processes are stuck in a cycle of 
                    waiting for each other to release resources, 
                    leading to a complete standstill. It is 
                    important to remove deadlocks because they 
                    result in unresponsive systems, decreased 
                    performance, and a failure to accomplish tasks. 
                    Deadlocks hinder the efficiency of concurrent 
                    systems, making it crucial to employ techniques 
                    like careful resource allocation and deadlock 
                    detection to prevent or resolve these situations 
                    and maintain overall system functionality.</p>

                <h3>Ideal solution of Dining Philosopers Problem</h3>
                <p>From the above video we can understand that once a philosopher is eating, the philosopher adjacent to him will not be able to eat. 
                    However, the philosopher after that will be able to eat as he does not have any fork in common with the philosopher eating. 
                 Once they both finish eating, the philosopher in the middle will be able to eat. This is very important in operating system for 
                resource location at a particular time instant. <br><br></p>

                <h2>One of the possible deadlocks</h2>
                <p>In the video, it is observed that each philosopher attempts to acquire one fork simultaneously. 
                    This leads to a situation where no philosopher obtains both forks, preventing anyone from enjoying 
                    their meal. To address this issue, a solution is proposed in the video. <br></p>

                    <br>
                </video>
                <h2>Solution to the deadlock</h2>
                <p> In the improved scenario, Philosopher 1 takes fork 1, but instead of Philosopher 2
                    also reaching for fork 2, they take fork 3. With fork 2 left unclaimed, Philosopher 1
                     can now pick up fork 2 and begin enjoying their food. Once finished, fork 2 
                     is then passed to Philosopher 2. Consequently, Philosopher 2 
                     now possesses both forks and can commence their meal. This strategy of having 
                     one philosopher choose the opposite side of the fork helps avoid a situation where 
                     everyone competes for a single fork. <br></p>
