    <p><b>What is Dining Philosophers Problem?</b><br><br>The dining philosopher's problem is the classical problem of synchronization which says that Five philosophers are sitting around a
        circular table and their job is to think and eat alternatively. A bowl of noodles is placed at the center of the table along with 
        five forks for each of the philosophers. To eat a philosopher needs both their right and a left fork. 
        A philosopher can only eat if both immediate left and right forks of the philosopher is available. In case if
        both immediate left and right forks of the philosopher are not available then the philosopher puts down their 
        (either left or right) fork and starts thinking again.<br><br>
        The dining philosopher demonstrates a large class of concurrency control problems hence it's a classic synchronization problem. In
        general we commonly use Semaphores and Mutex Locks as the synchronization mechanism. For this instance, we will be using only binary semaphore.
        <br><br>
        <b>What is a Semaphore?</b><br><br>
        In the Dining Philosophers problem, 
        a semaphore is a synchronization tool that helps manage access to shared resources, such as forks. It prevents conflicts by allowing philosophers to check and update the 
        availability of forks before picking them up to eat. Semaphores play a crucial role in avoiding deadlock and ensuring orderly 
        resource usage in a concurrent dining scenario.For this problem, we will be using binary semaphore which means that there can be only two answers that is
        True (1) or False (0).<br><br>
        <b>What is a deadlock and why is it important to remove?</b><br><br>
        A deadlock in concurrent programming happens when
                    multiple processes are stuck in a cycle of 
                    waiting for each other to release resources, 
                    leading to a complete standstill. It is 
                    important to remove deadlocks because they 
                    result in unresponsive systems, decreased 
                    performance, and a failure to accomplish tasks. 
                    Deadlocks hinder the efficiency of concurrent 
                    systems, making it crucial to employ techniques 
                    like careful resource allocation and deadlock 
                    detection to prevent or resolve these situations 
                    and maintain overall system functionality.
